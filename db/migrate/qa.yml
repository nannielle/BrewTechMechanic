question: "Is it important for the coffee machine to face the customer, or does it not matter?"
answer: "The placement of the coffee machine is very important as it creates a pleasant vibe for guests and for the barista during coffee preparation.

The longer the communication, the friendlier the atmosphere for customers.

It is also important for the barista to be able to quickly grind coffee (if necessary)

and for the coffee grinder to be located next to the coffee machine.

A minimum of 30 cm should be left between adjacent devices due to the risk of fire."

question: "What should be the height of the bar counter for customers and for the barista?"
answer: "The optimal height of the counter is 0.9 - 1.05 meters. This height is convenient for both guests and staff."

question: "Will one single-group coffee machine be enough for me, or do I need at least a 2-group coffee machine?"
answer: "This depends on the flow of guests in your cafe or restaurant. We recommend having at least one 2-group coffee machine.

This will allow you to prepare two drinks simultaneously without wasting time."

question: "Do i need a filter for my coffee machine?"
answer: "The quality of water is very important when operating a coffee machine.

We advise you to consult with professional filter manufacturers or their official distributors,

who will conduct a test of your water and help you choose a filter (you need to choose from this list:

a simple household water filter; a softener that reduces water hardness;

a multi-stage system with a charcoal column and several feeders; a reverse osmosis system).

For establishments specializing in coffee drinks,

you need to choose a filter by conducting laboratory water tests.

Water testing will help you decide which filter to choose to achieve the coffee taste level you need.

98% of a coffee cup is water, it should affect both the taste and the equipment.

Therefore, preparing a drink in a coffee machine should start with the selection and purification of water."

question: "What voltage is needed for the coffee machine?"
answer: "Our machines operate at 220 V.

Please consult a professional electrician who will check the grounding and correctly connect your coffee machine."

question: "Can high cups for takeaway coffee or thermoses be used?"
answer: "In automatic coffee machines, you can manually adjust the height by moving the coffee output block up or down.

The height of the pour on traditional coffee machines cannot be adjusted,

but you can always prepare coffee separately in a cup and pour it into a high glass or thermos."
