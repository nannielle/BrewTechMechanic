  - review: "Five stars! The service was so fast, I hadn't even finished downloading the customer service number they had already solved my problem. I mean, do they have wizards working there?"
  - review: "I'm convinced the service team is made up of mind readers. I barely thought about my issue and poof! Fixed. If they start offering lottery number predictions, I'm all in."
  - review: "I called for help and they were so cheerful, I forgot why I was even frustrated. Ended up chatting about my dog's birthday. 10/10 would have a crisis again just for the laughs."
  - review: "The moment I interacted with their customer service, my plants started thriving, my car started running better, and I found $20 in my jeans. Coincidence? I think not. #BlessedByCustomerService"
